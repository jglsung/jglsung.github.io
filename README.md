### Lab Environment: Infrastructure as Code with Vagrant, Ansible, and VirtualBox
**Description**: The goal of this lab is to create a multi-machine environment using Vagrant and VirtualBox, with Ansible automating the configuration of these machines. This environment will consist of multiple virtual machines (VMs) that can be used for various purposes, such as testing network configurations, simulating a production environment, or experimenting with different software stacks.
